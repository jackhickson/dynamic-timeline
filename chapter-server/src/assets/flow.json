It is difficult to cut it, but when she finally pierces the fish and looks inside she can see a yellow thing that vibrates when poked. It also sees some \"pale yellow-white pus ooze\" from inside. She assumes that this would be easy due to having the [Basic Cooking] skill but nothing special is happening. She realizes that maybe it needs to be cooked with a pan in the kitchen. As she goes back to butchering, her hand slips and slices her palm open."

Then they start asking questions about her origins. She tells them she was teleported and they assume a [Teleport] spell which would be a discussion for the Mage Guild. She says that she met a dragon and that there was a distinction between dragons and drakes and it was very unlikely for her to meet a dragon.

While discussing her they obviously have never interacted with a human for very long even a female one at that. Klbkch species is not \"Ant\" but \"Antinium\". They believe she is a runaway [Lady], maybe not even from this continent. They could tell she was not lying about seeing a dragon but believed she was most likely mistaken she would not have survived as they are known to defeat armies and none were nearby. They decide to go back to the inn during work the next day as part of an \"investigation\". The low-grade health potion was not merely low-grade and was a special order for other events. They would need to wait for a new shipment from \"Pallas\" when the \"Blood Fields are frozen\". Klbkch deems it worth using on a civilian in need.\n\nTerms first heard: Antinium, Watch Captain, Pallass, Blood Fields"
