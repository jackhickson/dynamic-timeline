It is difficult to cut it, but when she finally pierces the fish and looks inside she can see a yellow thing that vibrates when poked. It also sees some \"pale yellow-white pus ooze\" from inside. She assumes that this would be easy due to having the [Basic Cooking] skill but nothing special is happening. She realizes that maybe it needs to be cooked with a pan in the kitchen. As she goes back to butchering, her hand slips and slices her palm open."
