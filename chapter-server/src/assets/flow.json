He wonders if it was a spy from a [Necromancer], another dragon, or maybe \" [Knights]? A random [Hero]?\". A contingency message was sent in his surprise during the encounter to an unknown friend, wondering about his status. After finding no one or magic tracking or out-of-place after two weeks he determines it to be bad luck. \"She had to have been the subject of—of some chance. Maybe a [Gambler] or whatnot\". After doing some errands through magic to a nearby city he falls asleep in his cave."
